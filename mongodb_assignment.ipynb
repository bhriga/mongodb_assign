    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) database management system (DBMS) that is designed for scalability, \n",
    "flexibility, and performance. MongoDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), making it suitable for \n",
    "handling unstructured or semi-structured data. It uses a document-oriented model, where data is stored as documents composed of field-value pairs, \n",
    "similar to JSON objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases are databases that do not use the traditional tabular structure with rows and columns found in relational databases.\n",
    "Instead, they use flexible data models that can handle various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. \n",
    "Non-relational databases are often more scalable, flexible, and efficient for certain use cases compared to relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and high throughput. It is well-suited for applications that \n",
    "require horizontal scaling across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: MongoDB's document-oriented model allows for flexible schema design, making it easy to adapt to changing data requirements\n",
    "without altering the entire database schema. This flexibility is beneficial for applications with evolving data models or frequently\n",
    "changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Data Structures: MongoDB can handle complex, nested data structures and arrays natively, making it suitable for storing hierarchical data\n",
    "such as JSON documents, XML data, or complex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast Development: MongoDB's schema-less nature and dynamic schema make it easy to prototype and develop applications quickly, as developers\n",
    "can focus on application logic rather than database schema design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data and Analytics: MongoDB is well-suited for big data and analytics applications that require real-time analysis of large volumes of data. \n",
    "Its distributed architecture and support for MapReduce and aggregation pipelines enable efficient data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB offers built-in support for replication and automatic failover, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "It is suitable for mission-critical applications that require continuous uptime and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet of Things (IoT) and Real-Time Applications: MongoDB is often used in IoT and real-time applications that generate\n",
    "    large volumes of sensor data, event streams, or time-series data. Its flexible data model and horizontal scalability support \n",
    "    real-time data ingestion and processing.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. Below are some of the\n",
    "key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB uses a flexible document-oriented data model, where data is stored as BSON (Binary JSON) documents.\n",
    "Documents are similar to JSON objects and can contain nested fields, arrays, and other complex data structures.\n",
    "This flexible schema design allows for easy adaptation to changing data requirements without the need for complex schema migrations.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is designed to scale out horizontally across multiple servers or clusters to handle large volumes of data and high throughput.\n",
    "It supports sharding, which allows data to be distributed across multiple nodes, enabling horizontal scaling while maintaining data integrity\n",
    "and availability.\n",
    "High Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides high performance for read and write operations, with support for in-memory caching, indexing, and query optimization.\n",
    "It uses a memory-mapped storage engine that leverages the operating system's memory management for efficient data access.\n",
    "Rich Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB offers a powerful and expressive query language that supports a wide range of operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete),\n",
    "aggregation, sorting, filtering, and text search.\n",
    "Queries can be executed using the MongoDB Query Language (MQL), which is similar to SQL but optimized for document-based data.\n",
    "Indexing and Aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports indexing on fields to improve query performance and enable efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "It also provides aggregation pipelines, which allow complex data processing and analysis operations to be performed directly within the database.\n",
    "Automatic Failover and Replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports automatic failover and data redundancy through replica sets.\n",
    "Replica sets consist of multiple nodes, including primary and secondary nodes, which automatically elect a new primary node in case of primary node\n",
    "    failure, ensuring high availability and data durability.\n",
    "Schema Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB allows for schema validation to enforce data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "You can define validation rules at the collection level to ensure that documents meet certain criteria before being inserted or updated.\n",
    "Horizontal and Vertical Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports both horizontal scaling (sharding) and vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server) to accommodate growing data\n",
    "volumes and user loads.\n",
    "It offers flexibility in choosing the scaling strategy that best fits the application's requirements and infrastructure.\n",
    "Agile Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB's flexible schema design, dynamic data model, and fast development cycles support agile development practices.\n",
    "It allows developers to iterate quickly, prototype new features, and adapt to changing business requirements without being constrained\n",
    "by rigid schema designs."

    "Copy code\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Drop the collection named 'customers'\n",
    "collection.drop()\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "delete_one(): This method is useful when you want to delete a single document based on specific criteria, such as removing a user account or a\n",
    "      specific record.\n",
    "delete_many(): This method is useful for bulk deletion of documents based on certain criteria, such as cleaning up old data or removing duplicate\n",
    "      entries.\n",
    "drop(): This method is used when you want to delete an entire collection, such as when you no longer need the collection or want to start fresh\n",
    "      with a new collection structure.\n",
    "It's important to use these methods carefully, especially drop(), as it permanently deletes data from the database. Always double-check your filter\n",
